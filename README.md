### Contributing a new template

We intend to keep the number of templates in this repository to a minimum, and so will unlikely accept any new templates. The goal is for these templates to be a good starting point for many projects, as well as other community templates.

## Templates

### Official Templates

The following templates are maintained by the React Router team. For more information on each template, checkout out the README of the template repository.

**Default template:**

A full-featured production-ready template with server-side rendering, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and Docker support. Perfect for building scalable applications with built-in asset optimization and hot module replacement.

```bash
npx create-react-router@latest
```

**Minimal template:**

A lightweight template used for https://reactrouter.com/new. Designed for experimentation and demo applications. Not recommended for production use, but ideal for learning React Router's core concepts or creating reproductions.

```bash
npx create-react-router@latest --template remix-run/react-router-templates/minimal
```

**JavaScript only template:**

A TypeScript-free version of the default template, offering the same production-ready features but without type checking. Great for teams preferring plain JavaScript.

```bash
npx create-react-router@latest --template remix-run/react-router-templates/javascript
